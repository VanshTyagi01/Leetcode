/*
 * 
 * S -> Single Responsibility System (SRS) One Class, One Function!
 * O -> Open Close Principle (Class open for extension, close for modification) (inherit calss for modification)
 * L -> Liskov substitution Principle 
 *      (function that use reference to base classes must be able to use object of derived classes wihtout knowing it)
 * I -> Interface Segration Principle (class should not be force to use method that do not use from abstract class)
 * D -> Dependency Inversion Principle (classes must depends upon abstraction when talking to each other)
 *      example -> in ecommerce customer is talking to factory then factory is talking to order and returning
 *                 order object whle upcasting it to IOrder interface so only those function can run that are in 
 *                 interface IOrder
 * 
 * 
 * polymorphism -> enable polymorphic behaviour, making code more flexible and reusable
 * polymorphic function -> object that works for bout parent and chils class function calling(UP-CASTING, DOWN-CASTING)
